- copy the original list
- read each word in the list and sort them
= after sorting - make the sorted word the key and the word a value in a list
- if the second sored word is in the list append to the key
- finally return the list of list values as result

Time Complexity:
    O(n*k*log k)
    n is the length of the strs
    k is maximum length of each string
    k log k is the time taken to sort each string

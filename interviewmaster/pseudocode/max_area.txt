we have list of hieghts in an array. We should calculate the max_area
height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
I will start looking for the maxValue in the array and store it as max_value.
If this max_value  > previous seen value:
    We also need set this as max_value
    There is a leak
I still go about looking for next values, 
    if less there is a leak
    if i find something equal or greater, then in know the previous leaks can be fixed
    Now, i should also know, if i can shift the maxValue to a new found value based on the max_area 
    so far calculated
But what is the max_area, while it is 7 * 7 which is 49
    We need the max_height
    And max_distance in x-axis at every set without leak
    So that we decide whether to reset or not
    First it is not possible to take the decision here, as the leak can be fixed last as well

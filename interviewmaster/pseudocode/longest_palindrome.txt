question - to return a longest palindrome from a string

    - create a function isPalindrome which takes a string and returns a boolean 
    - now in the input string, how do i find the longest string which is palindrome
    - where should i start the string,if it is not, how do i restart
    - assuming i start from left and right, now if it not palindrome, should i reduce left or right
    - 


Time Complexity - O(n^2)
    - as we are checking for every character if it is palindrome, with every other character in the string
Space Complexity - O(1)
    - as we are just using one string called longest and two temporary strings, for odd and even

we need a new datastructure called Trie form of tree
    - store and retrieve strings
    - it should O(1) - the meaning of efficient  or O(log 1)

    - if i have a string, what are the necessary attributes to achieve the best possible result for insert, search, startsWith
        - length of the string - i can go by binary search or some hash to identify the unique string
        - the above or some logic based on some other attribute is needed to insert and search the string in O(log n)
        - if so, the tree should have those attributes plus left and right
        - length, the string itself, ??
        - startsWith - how will it find quickly or match if i give some letters, there is no cap as well for the prefix

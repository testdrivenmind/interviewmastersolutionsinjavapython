Solution 1:
create a list
Travel the TreeNode in preorder
put the values in the list
Create a TreeNode with the values in the list with only the TreeNode.right having values


Solution 2:
If we have to to do in place, without extra space, then we have to look at recursion
    what is the base case to stop the recursion?
        - when tree.left becomes null, add it to tree.right
    
    one -level smaller problem
        - preorder traversal - not sure 

The above is my thought process, are both correct. 

Let us first go with solution 1. Then come to recursion which is solution2.
Please help me refine my though process for solution 1 without giving the solution.
